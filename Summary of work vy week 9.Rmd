So far, we have tried to see if it is possible to fit a Lee-Carter model for mortality predicions and the Lee-Carter model extended with a birth-year cohort effect using inlabru. The first results are good, but we have only tested the model for synthetic data, not necessarily very close to the real-life situation. 

We have used the follwing version of the Lee-Carter model:
$$
Y_{x,t} \sim Poisson(E_{x,t}\cdot e^{\eta_{x,t}}), 
$$
where $Y_{x,t}$ is the expected number of deaths for people at age $x$ in year $t$ and 
$$
\eta_{x,t}=\alpha_x + \beta_x\cdot\kappa_t + \epsilon. 
$$
