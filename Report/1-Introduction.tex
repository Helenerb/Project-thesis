\section{Introduction}
In this paper, we will look at the model originally proposed by Lee and Carter, as well as some extensions of it, and examine if it is possible to fit data to this kind of model using an extension of the \inla method. 

In this paper, we mainly investigate this new method of inference for Lee-Carter methods for mortality projection. The Lee-Carter framework have also been used to model other types of population development, such as fertility rates and immigration and emigration. Even though we do not explicitly test the \inlabru-framework for this type of modelling explicitly, we do not see any reasons that the results from the investigation of mortality predictions are not applicable to these models also.
